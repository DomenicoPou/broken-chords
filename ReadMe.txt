[b]Tools needed for this code to work[/b]
You'll need to install loopMidi. (this makes virtual midi instruments which ableton can read from)
Open it and make 3 ports called midi1, midi2, etc.

Use the ableton file that is located in the "ableton files folder"

A USB or Inbuilt Camera would suffice

You'll need a Adafruit LED Strip with (Currently): 240 LED's, which equates to 4 metres.

Any arduino that is able to send data and power a 4 metre LED strip. PIN 3 is the data. 5v is what we used


[b]To make the prototype work:[/b]
The above tools needed are essential, if the camera, arduino and midi loops are not able to be opened
or accessed

Visual studios might also be essential. we havent tested with any other c# programs


Note: White surfaces are meant to be blanks, not really needed

Happy making colour into midi!!

You'll need to install loopMidi. (this makes virtual midi instruments which ableton can read from)
Open it and make 4 ports called midi1, midi2, etc.

Use C# midi toolkit code to send midi signals to those midi devices.

Use the ableton file that is located in the "ableton files folder"


To make the prototype work:
if you want to use the prototype, open the controller object in unity and make it run the prototype script, if not make it run the main script.

Make a directory in your C:\\ called "WebcamSnaps"

Move the contents of the folder "Assets" to the WebcamSnaps folder


You might need to make the default open program for .ps1 files powershell, otherwise it will open in notepad
